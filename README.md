  <p>Ten to fifty years after hatching (depending on the species), adult sea turtles reach sexual maturity and are able to mate. Once they reach sexual maturity they will migrate to beaches around the world to nest. Only females will come ashore to lay eggs, generally in the area where they were born. this is why preservation of total habitat is so important the <a href="https://www.oceanicsociety.org/our-work/sea-turtle-conservation/">Oceanic Society</a> Oceanic Society leads the only globally focused sea turtle conservation program, fulfilling a need in sea turtle conservation that was previously unmet.</p><a href="https://www.oceanicsociety.org/our-work/sea-turtle-conservation/"></a>
